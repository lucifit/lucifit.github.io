In pain management, we use a combination of treatment modalities tailored to your presentation to manage or reduce the pain and discomfort. The difference of pain management compared to other services is that within a treatment session the practitioner will assess you and depending on the findings, will select and use a combination of treatment modalities that are most appropriate for you.

Some examples of the treatment modalities can include:
1. stretch and mobility
2. dry needling
3. scraping/percussive massage therapy
4. cupping therapy
5. Sports/Relaxing/Deep tissue massage
