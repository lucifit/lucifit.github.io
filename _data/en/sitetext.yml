  title: About Us
  body: |
   Located in the heart of London on Baker Street, we take a holistic approach to health and beauty, combining Aesthetic Injections (Anti-Wrinkle Treatments, Dermal Fillers) with Osteopathy to enhance both how you feel and how you look.
  
   Originally from Italy, I speak both Italian and English, allowing me to provide care in both languages for a more personalized experience.
  
   With several years of experience in aesthetic medicine, I specialize in natural, subtle enhancements that refine your features rather than alter them. My goal is to enhance your unique beauty—not to change it—helping you look refreshed, youthful, and confident. I continuously refine my skills, staying up to date with the latest advancements to provide the most precise and effective treatments.
  
   Beyond aesthetics, my expertise in osteopathy allows me to take a comprehensive approach to care. With over a decade of experience in personal training and sports massage therapy, I have a deep understanding of movement, function, and recovery, which enhances my work as an osteopath. My treatments go beyond symptom relief to address the root cause of discomfort, helping restore balance and long-term well-being. I use techniques such as joint mobilization, dry needling, myofascial release, soft tissue therapy, and spinal manipulations (HVT – the controlled, precise techniques often known as “clicking” or “adjustments”) to relieve pain and improve mobility. Even relaxation-focused treatments are approached with an expert clinical perspective to maximize their effectiveness.
