    title: "About Me"
    text: "Luca Lucifora (Founder of LuciFIT H&W) - A Journey of Passion and Dedication"
    body: |
      Greetings, I'm Luca Lucifora, born in the picturesque setting of Italy in 1991, where I began my journey as the youngest of seven brothers in a close-knit family. This upbringing instilled in me the profound value of trustworthiness and reliability. It taught me humility, consideration, and the importance of treating every individual with respect. One enduring lesson from my beloved mother was the simple yet powerful principle: "Treat others as you would like to be treated." I firmly believe in the transformative power of kindness and its ability to usher in positive karma.  

      My passion for progression and personal development has been a driving force throughout my life. I possess an insatiable curiosity, perpetually seeking new avenues for self-improvement and knowledge expansion. This relentless pursuit of growth led me to the vibrant city of London.  

      It was here that my passion for 'fixing' things and the profound satisfaction derived from aiding others coalesced, leading me to the path of a manual therapist. This profession allows me to make a tangible difference in people's lives, both physically and mentally.  
      
      Over the years, I've undertaken a multitude of training courses and amassed extensive experience in the world of fitness. A glimpse into my journey includes:  
      - In 2013, I completed dual courses in personal training and sports massage therapy, setting the foundation for my career.
      - In 2018, I achieved notable successes, securing 2nd and 3rd place in several bodybuilding competitions.
      - In 2019, I embarked on an osteopathy postgraduate course at the esteemed University College of Osteopathy (UCO). This journey was complemented by additional courses in dry needling, scraping, and Swedish massage.
      - In the early months of 2023, I expanded my horizons further by successfully completing a comprehensive course in the use of botulinum toxin, lip and facial filler, and skin booster treatments for aesthetic enhancement.
      
      Today, I find myself at a pivotal juncture in my career, reflecting on the achievements thus far and eagerly anticipating the boundless opportunities that the future holds.  
      
      My journey is not just about professional growth; it's a testament to the power of passion, dedication, and a commitment to making a positive impact in the lives of others. Thank you for joining me on this remarkable odyssey.
