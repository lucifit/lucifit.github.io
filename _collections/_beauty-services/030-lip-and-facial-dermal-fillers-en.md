Dermal fillers are cosmetic injectables designed to add volume, contour, and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. They are commonly used to restore a more youthful and refreshed appearance. Unlike botulinum toxin, which relaxes muscles to reduce wrinkles, fillers work by adding volume to the treated area.  

Here's how dermal fillers generally work:
- Composition:  
  Dermal fillers are typically made of various substances, and the specific type of filler used can vary. Common filler ingredients include hyaluronic acid, collagen, calcium hydroxylapatite, and poly-L-lactic acid. Hyaluronic acid is one of the most widely used and versatile fillers.

- Injection Process:  
The filler is injected beneath the skin's surface, directly into the targeted areas. The injection is performed with a fine needle or a cannula, depending on the technique and the area being treated.

- Volume Restoration:  
Once injected, the filler adds volume to the treated area, filling in wrinkles, lines, or areas with lost volume. It helps to restore a smoother, plumper appearance to the skin.

- Stimulation of Collagen Production:  
In addition to providing immediate volume, some fillers stimulate the production of collagen, a protein that supports the structure and elasticity of the skin. This collagen production contributes to longer-term improvements in skin texture and firmness.

- Duration of Effects:  
The duration of filler effects varies based on the type of filler used. Some fillers provide temporary results, lasting several months to a year, while others offer longer-lasting results.
