Lymphatic drainage is a light massage on the skin that helps promote the movement of lymphatic fluid. In contrast to other massage approaches, lymphatic drainage focuses specifically on lymph vessels to assist the flow of the lymph.

**Mechanisms of action**
- Stimulation of lymph nodes to improve their function [1].
- Increases blood flow in both deep and superficial veins [2].
- Improving the immune system by increasing the production of lymph cells.
- Reducing toxins in the body.
While lymphatic drainage is mainly used to treat lymphoedema (swelling in legs or arms) it has also been scientifically proven beneficial in:
- Pain relief/management [3]
- Post- orthopedic surgery pain reduction and increase in ranges of movement [4]
- Migraine pain reduction [5]
- Swelling in legs, arms, face.
- Swelling and pain reduction after liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty.[6]
- Psychological stress management [7]
- Stretch marks reduction 
- Cellulitis management
