Sports massage therapy involves manual manipulation of muscles and soft tissue with the purpose of improving performance and recovery [1]. The techniques used aim to enhance circulation, reduce muscle tension and improve tissue elasticity. The main difference of sports massage compared to regular massage is that sports massage targets specific regions of the body, depending on the presentation of the client.
Effects of sports massage according to research:
1. Significantly increases flexibility [2,3]  
2. Reduces muscle fatigue [4]  
3. Reduced Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) [5]  
4. Can potentially increase strength and athletic performance [6]
