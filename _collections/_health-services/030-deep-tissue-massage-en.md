Myofascial Release & Trigger Point Therapy is a specialized osteopathic-based treatment designed to release fascial restrictions, alleviate muscle knots (trigger points), and restore mobility. Unlike traditional deep tissue massage, this approach targets connective tissue (fascia) and neuromuscular trigger points, addressing the root cause of pain and tension rather than just the symptoms.

Using sustained pressure and precise techniques, this therapy helps break down adhesions, improve circulation, and promote better movement. It is particularly effective for individuals experiencing chronic pain, postural imbalances, or conditions like fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and nerve impingement.

Benefits of Myofascial Release & Trigger Point Therapy:
- Reduces chronic pain by releasing muscle knots and fascial restrictions.
- Improves range of motion & flexibility by enhancing tissue elasticity.
- Alleviates tension headaches, postural strain, and nerve compression.
- Enhances circulation & reduces muscular stiffness, aiding in recovery.
- More effective than traditional massage for persistent musculoskeletal issues such as low back pain.
By integrating osteopathic techniques, this therapy ensures that pressure is applied with anatomical precision, allowing for a deep yet controlled release that promotes long-term relief and functional improvement.
