Dry needling is a procedure where a small needle is inserted into the
muscle, aiming to treat trigger points. Trigger points are muscular
nodules that are palpable and tender. These nodules can cause pain on
the surrounding area and to distant areas of the body, a phenomenon
called \'\'referred pain\'\'.\[1\]

**Evidence-based effects of dry needling therapy**

-   **Reduce pain in**:
  1.  Knee/Hip osteoarthritis \[3\]
  2.  Piriformis syndrome \[4\]
  3.  Carpal tunnel syndrome \[5\]
  4.  Migraines and other types of headaches \[6\]
  5.  Shoulder pain, Neck pain, Low back pain \[7\],\[8\],\[9\]
  6.  Plantar fasciitis \[10\]

**Is it a painful procedure?**  
Even if the insertion of a needle in the muscle might seem painful, the
needles are very thin and don\'t cause pain. There are times when the
insertion of the needle might cause a muscle twitch, but this is not
commonly described as painful by the patients.

**Am I going to be sore?**  
As with most musculskeletal treatments, there might be some mild muscle
soreness for 24-48 hours following a treatment.
